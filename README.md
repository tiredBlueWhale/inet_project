# Internet and Network Security project

## ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning

### Project idea

To use ARP poisoning to inject malice files when the user downloads a file.
Our setup will discover if someone downlaods a file, and instead our file is downloaded

### Goal

To have a docker container which has all the needed tools, programs, scripts, ... installed

#### Road map

- [ ] Manage ARP spoofing
- [ ] Listening to downloads and what files
- [ ] Replace downloaded file with our file
